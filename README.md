# Median_by_Heaps
Implementation of Heap, MaxHeap(Heap), MinHeap(Heap) and Median (using MinHeap &amp; MaxHeap) classes, which allow to dynamically determine current median(s) of given array. Elements of array are delivered to Median one by one and added to the structure by Heap's add_element() method.
